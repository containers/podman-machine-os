# 1. For main branch builds, replace aardvark-dns, conmon, crun, netavark, podman, containers-common
# 2. For release branch builds, fetch the build from the copr job on the podman
# release PR.
# 3. Remove moby-engine, containerd, runc, zincati for both dev and release builds
# Note: Currently does not result in a size reduction for the container image
# 4. Even though the URLs mention `rawhide`, the repo and gpg files are Fedora
# release agnostic and such `rawhide` URLs are unlikely to change compared to URLs
# containing Fedora release numbers.
